## Instructions

- Compare with bundler-based dev servers.
- Explain dependency pre-bundling with esbuild.
- Highlight module graph based HMR.

### Example

```md
- Bundlers: full bundle on dev start
- Vite: pre-bundle deps + native ESM for source
```

### Notes

- Use when users compare Vite to Webpack.
