# PartMeAI Skills Marketplace

A free skills marketplace providing various practical AI skill collections that can be used in Claude Code.

> **Note:** This repository merges Anthropic's example skills and Agent Skills collections, providing various practical AI skills that can be used in Claude Code, Claude.ai, and the API. For information about the Agent Skills standard, see [agentskills.io](http://agentskills.io).

## What are Skills?

Skills are folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that Claude loads dynamically to improve performance on specialized tasks. Skills teach Claude how to complete specific tasks in a repeatable way, whether that's creating documents with your company's brand guidelines, analyzing data using your organization's specific workflows, or automating personal tasks.

## About This Repository

This repository contains skills that demonstrate what's possible with Claude's skills system. These skills range from creative applications (art, music, design) to technical tasks (testing web apps, MCP server generation) to enterprise workflows (communications, branding, etc.), as well as teaching and education scenarios.

Each skill is self-contained in its own folder with a `SKILL.md` file containing the instructions and metadata that Claude uses. You can browse through these skills to get inspiration for your own skills or to understand different patterns and approaches.

Many skills in this repo are open source (Apache 2.0). We've also included the document creation & editing skills that power [Claude's document capabilities](https://www.anthropic.com/news/create-files) under the hood in the [`skills/docx`](skills/docx), [`skills/pdf`](skills/pdf), [`skills/pptx`](skills/pptx), and [`skills/xlsx`](skills/xlsx) subfolders. These are source-available, not open source, but we wanted to share these with developers as a reference for more complex skills that are actively used in a production AI application.

### Disclaimer

**These skills are provided for demonstration and educational purposes only.** While some of these capabilities may be available in Claude, the implementations and behaviors you receive from Claude may differ from what is shown in these skills. These skills are meant to illustrate patterns and possibilities. Always test skills thoroughly in your own environment before relying on them for critical tasks.

## How to Create a New Skill

### Creating a Basic Skill

Skills are simple to create - just a folder with a `SKILL.md` file containing YAML frontmatter and instructions. You can use the **template-skill** in this repository as a starting point:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill-name
description: A clear description of what this skill does and when to use it
---

# My Skill Name

[Add your instructions here that Claude will follow when this skill is active]

## Examples
- Example usage 1
- Example usage 2

## Guidelines
- Guideline 1
- Guideline 2
```

The frontmatter requires only two fields:
- `name` - A unique identifier for your skill (lowercase, hyphens for spaces)
- `description` - A complete description of what the skill does and when to use it

The markdown content below contains the instructions, examples, and guidelines that Claude will follow. For more details, see [How to create custom skills](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12512198-creating-custom-skills).

### Skill Structure

Each skill contains:
- `SKILL.md` - Instructions for the agent (required)
- `scripts/` - Helper scripts for automation (optional)
- `references/` - Supporting documentation (optional)
- `assets/` - Resource files (optional)

### Steps to Add a New Skill

#### 1. Create Skill Directory

Create a new skill directory under the `skills/` directory:

```bash
mkdir -p skills/your-skill-name
```

#### 2. Create SKILL.md File

Each skill must contain a `SKILL.md` file with the format shown above.

#### 3. Update marketplace.json

Add the new skill to the appropriate plugin in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`:

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "your-plugin-name",
      "description": "Plugin description",
      "source": "./",
      "strict": false,
      "skills": [
        "./skills/your-skill-name"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 4. Commit to GitHub

Commit and push changes to the GitHub repository:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add new skill: your-skill-name"
git push
```

## Marketplace Configuration File

The `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` file defines the marketplace metadata and available plugins:

```json
{
  "name": "marketplace-name",        // Marketplace name
  "owner": {                         // Owner information
    "name": "Owner Name",
    "email": "owner@example.com"
  },
  "metadata": {                      // Metadata
    "description": "Marketplace description",
    "version": "1.0.0"
  },
  "plugins": [                       // Plugin list
    {
      "name": "plugin-name",         // Plugin name
      "description": "Plugin description",
      "source": "./",                // Source code path
      "strict": false,               // Strict mode
      "skills": [                    // Skills list
        "./skills/skill1",
        "./skills/skill2"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## How It Works

1. **Marketplace Registration**: When you run `/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/partme-ai/full-stack-skills.git`, Claude Code will:
   - Fetch the `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` file from the GitHub repository
   - Parse the marketplace configuration
   - Add the marketplace to the available list

2. **Plugin Installation**: When you install a plugin, Claude Code will:
   - Download all skills defined in the plugin
   - Store skills locally
   - Make skills available to Claude

3. **Skill Usage**: When you use a skill, Claude will:
   - Determine whether to use the skill based on its description
   - Load the skill's `SKILL.md` file
   - Execute tasks according to the skill instructions

## Best Practices

### Skill Design

- **Clear Description**: The `description` field should clearly state when to use the skill
- **Concise Content**: Keep `SKILL.md` concise, avoid unnecessary verbosity (recommended under 500 lines)
- **Structured Organization**: Use clear sections and structure
- **Practical Examples**: Provide practical, usable examples
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Put detailed reference materials in separate files and load them as needed

### Marketplace Organization

- **Logical Grouping**: Organize related skills into the same plugin
- **Clear Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names
- **Version Management**: Maintain version numbers in `metadata`

## License
